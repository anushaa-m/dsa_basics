all the basic dsa learnt <br>
This repository contains implementations of core data structures in C.
I focused on understanding memory management, pointer manipulation,
and time/space complexity of common operations.

Stack (LL): Push & Pop → O(1)<br>

Priority Queue (LL): Enqueue → O(n), Dequeue → O(1)<br>

Expression Tree: Construction & Traversals → O(n)<br>

Set Operations: Union/Intersection/Difference → O(n×m)<br>

BST Operations: O(log n) average, O(n) worst<br>

Job Recommendation System: O(S×N + J²)<br>
